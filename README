Performing a release:

Make sure that implementation changes in modules are reflected in 
updated micro version numbers! E.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1

Make sure that api changes in modules are reflected by updated 
minor version numbers! E.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0

Make sure that incompatible api changes in modules are reflected by
updated major version numbers! E.g. 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0

Incompatible API changes usually involve restructuring of the module's
public APIs, so that legacy code would no longer compile against/work at runtime.

Increase the version within nbproject/project.properties
to indicate a new application version:

app.version.major=1
app.version.minor=2
app.version.micro=1

Increase the micro version for bugfixes or minor functionality improvements.
Increase the minor version for new functionality.
Increase the major number for major new functionality and/or incompatible API changes.

Make sure that the site/ is updated to reflect the new release version (check paths).

Commit all pending changes. 
Create a release tag.

Open an ssh connection to sourceforge:

>ssh -t SFUSERNAME,maltcms@shell.sourceforge.net create

From the IDE, run 

"Package As->Installers"

to create the platform specific installers. This is currently not easily possible from ANT

Run 
>ant release-and-deploy

to build, test, and deploy the application.
